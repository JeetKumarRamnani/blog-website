                            As technology continues to evolve, the demand for full-stack developers is increasing
                            rapidly. Full-stack developers are those who can work with both front-end and back-end
                            technologies, as well as have a strong understanding of databases and server-side
                            architecture. If you're interested in becoming a full-stack developer, here's a guide to
                            help you get started.
                            <br />

                            <span class="text-2xl font-semibold block my-5">1. Learn the Fundamentals of
                                Programming</span>
                            Before you can become a full-stack developer, you need to have a strong foundation in
                            programming. This includes understanding concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and
                            programming paradigms. You can learn these fundamentals by taking online courses, reading
                            books, or attending coding bootcamps.

                            <br />
                            <br />

                            <span class="text-2xl font-semibold block my-5">2. Choose a Programming Language</span>
                            Once you have a strong foundation in programming, it's time to choose a programming language
                            to specialize in. Some popular languages for full-stack development include JavaScript,
                            Python, and Ruby. Each language has its own set of advantages and disadvantages, so it's
                            important to choose one that aligns with your goals.
